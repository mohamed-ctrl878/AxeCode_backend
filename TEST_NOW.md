## 🎯 Quick Test Steps

### 1. Create Test Data (One-time setup)

Visit: http://localhost:1337/admin

**Create a Conversation:**
1. Go to Content Manager → Conversation
2. Click "Create new entry"
3. Title: "Test Chat"
4. Add yourself to `users_permissions_users`
5. Click "Save" and "Publish"

**Note the ID** (should be `1` if it's your first)

---

### 2. Test the Chat

1. **Open app**: http://localhost:3000
2. **Login** with your credentials
3. **Click "💬 Chat"** button in navigation
4. **Type a message** and click "Send"
5. **Check browser console** - you should see:
   ```
   [Socket] Connected abc123
   ```

---

### 3. Test Real-time (The Magic Moment!)

1. **Open a second browser tab** (or incognito window)
2. Go to http://localhost:3000 and login
3. Click "💬 Chat" in both tabs
4. **Send message from Tab 1**
5. **Watch it appear INSTANTLY in Tab 2!** ✨

---

## 🔍 What to Check

### Backend Console (Strapi):
```
✅ [Socket.io] WebSocket server initialized
✅ [Socket.io] New connection: abc123
✅ [Socket.io] Socket abc123 joined room: conversation-1
✅ [Lifecycle] Broadcasted message 1 to room: conversation-1
```

### Frontend Console (Browser):
```
✅ [Socket] Connected abc123
```

### Network Tab:
```
✅ WebSocket connection to ws://localhost:1337
✅ Status: 101 Switching Protocols
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Can't see WebSocket initialization?
```bash
# Restart Strapi
npm run dev
```

### Frontend not connecting?
1. Check `.env` file has:
   ```
   REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:1337
   ```
2. Restart React:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Messages not appearing?
1. Check conversation ID in `frontend/src/App.js` (line 407):
   ```javascript
   <Chat conversationId={1} currentUser={user} />
   ```
2. Make sure conversation with that ID exists in Strapi

### Port already in use?
```bash
# Strapi port 1337
netstat -ano | findstr :1337

# React port 3000
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
```
